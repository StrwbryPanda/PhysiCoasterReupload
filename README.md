 In collaboration with the Marietta Middle School, a team of Kennesaw State University students will create a STEM-based, educational video game for Mr. Anthony Aksentis’ classroom to teach his students about potential and kinetic energy. The five students assigned to this project are members of Dr. Joy Li’s CGDD4303 Spring 2022 course, Educational and Serious Game Development, and have committed to this semester-long project as the Slime Squad.
